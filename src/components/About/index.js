        {/* &emsp;Hello, my name is Bobby Bridges. I am a father, grandfather, soccer fan and independant business owner. I have
        been in the tech world since I was a kid taking
        audio gear apart to figure out how it worked and how to make it do different things I wanted to make it do.
        That enginuity brought me to the audio/video and automation
        world back in July of 2000. From there I have rose to be one of the leading salesmen at HI-FI FO-FUM.  I've since honed my skills
        in high end audio, high end video, whole house automation & integration.  And I'm pleased to add top quality network systems and service
        to the resume.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        &emsp;My list of services offered range from almost any technology utilized in the home.
        My true skill is making technology nice and approachable for almost anyone.  Regardless of age or technical
        propensity.  Lets explore whats possible and make those tech dreams come true!
